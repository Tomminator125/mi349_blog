        Hi, my name is Tom Weir and I am a student and game developer at Michigan State university. I am currently finishing out my degree here and have begun working on my first major game project. If you are on this site, that means that you have somehow stumbled upon my blog. I plan on posting updates about games and minor rants that I go on. Outside of school and game dev, I play quadball and chill with my 2 cats, Missle launcher (Missy) and Martini (Tini), and my boyfriend, Fin. I cant promise that this blog will be all that active after this semeseter, but I do hope to keep it somewhat active.
     </p>
