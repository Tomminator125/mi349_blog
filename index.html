        <h2>What is Anti-Cavern?</h2>
        <p>
            Anti-Cavern is a game that began taking shape in my head right as I was leaving highschool. This also happened to be during the height of the Covid pandemic during 2020. I was able to write up a story and began thinking of what the gameplay would be. At the time I did not have any game dev experience which is part of why I enrolled at MSU to begin with. The game is centered around a teenage game dev who is struggling to make their first game and falls asleep at their desk one night. They are transported to a world that is almost completely unfinished and without color. After making it through the tutorial area, they are greeted by a desk and once they sit at it, the color red begins to fill the area creating red objects like flowers and adding red hues to the ground. A cutscene plays and the first color is added to the world. As the game progresses, more colors are added each bringing their own abilities and story beats. The story of the game follows the emotions of the character such as the idea phase, the building phase, getting inspiration, and burnout among other things.

        <h2>Why Pokemon Black and White are the best Pokemon games</h2>
        <p>
            Pokemon has a long and storied history. With 9 generations and countless spin off titles,it is hard to definitively say what pokemon game is the best. In this essay I will explain why in my personal opinion the fifth generation of the series was the best games that Game Freak and The Pokemon Company have made even to this day. Pokemon Black and White (BW) released together on September 18, 2010. This was the last generation to not feature a major battle gimmick that we have seen for the last four generations such as mega evolution or terrastalization, which makes it feel like a cap to the first era of pokemon. These games also introduced the most new pokemon and are the only games to have a direct sequel (B2W2). One of the areas that these games shine is in its story. Pokemon games are not often known for their story as it typically follows a rather linear storyline: Start your journey, challenge gyms, defeat the evil team of the region, catch the box art legendary, beat the champion. While BW doesnt do much to innovate on this, it manages to do it in a more compelling way than the other games in the main series.
