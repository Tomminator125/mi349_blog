            <p>
                Anti-Cavern is a game that began taking shape in my head right as I was leaving highschool. This also
                happened to be during the height of the Covid pandemic during 2020. I was able to write up a story and
                began
                thinking of what the gameplay would be. At the time I did not have any game dev experience which is part
                of
                why I enrolled at MSU to begin with. The game is centered around a teenage game dev who is struggling to
                make their first game and falls asleep at their desk one night. They are transported to a world that is
                almost completely unfinished and without color. After making it through the tutorial area, they are
                greeted
                by a desk and once they sit at it, the color red begins to fill the area creating red objects like
                flowers
                and adding red hues to the ground. A cutscene plays and the first color is added to the world. As the
                game
                progresses, more colors are added each bringing their own abilities and story beats. The story of the
                game
                follows the emotions of the character such as the idea phase, the building phase, getting inspiration,
                and
                burnout among other things. The project got abanodoned during the pandemic however, it never left my
                mind.
                Now that I am almost done with shool, I think I might start working on it again.

            <h3>Why Pokemon Black and White are the best Pokemon games</h3>
            <a class="byline" rel="author" href="/about.html">Tom Weir</a>

            <p>
                Pokemon has a long and storied history. With 9 generations and countless spin off titles,it is hard to
                definitively say what pokemon game is the best. In this essay I will explain why in my personal opinion
                the
                fifth generation of the series was the best games that Game Freak and The Pokemon Company have made even
                to
                this day. Pokemon Black and White (BW) released together on September 18, 2010. This was the last
                generation
                to not feature a major battle gimmick that we have seen for the last four generations such as mega
                evolution
                or terrastalization, which makes it feel like a cap to the first era of pokemon. These games also
                introduced
                the most new pokemon and are the only games to have a direct sequel (B2W2). One of the areas that these
                games shine is in its story. Pokemon games are not often known for their story as it typically follows a
                rather linear storyline: Start your journey, challenge gyms, defeat the evil team of the region, catch
                the
                box art legendary, beat the champion. While BW doesnt do much to innovate on this, it manages to do it
                in a
                more compelling way than the other games in the main series.
